            <h2>The world will change, you’ll change</h2>
            <p><i>"There is nothing permanent, except change.” — Heraclitus"</i></p>
            <p>Long term planning is extremely difficult, and more often than not, an impossible task. Reason: Your needs and wants will constantly change. They will change because you want to change, or they will change simply because the world around you will change. The world changes, you circumstances change. Circumstances change, then your wants and needs will change.</p>
            <p>We tend to overestimate how much we have changed in the past, and underestimate how much we are going to change in the future. You often hear about people changing careers 7 times during their lifetime. A recent poll found that approximately half (52%) of American employees are considering making a career change this year. 44% are already planning to make the switch.</p>
            <p>Change comes from other significant changes that we all experience, like our emotional health maturing or ending a relationship. It could be aging, retirement, or simply who you choose to invest your time in. It could be a new career, moving across the country (or world), or another life-changing event that catalyzes big change. Change is inevitable. It often causes us to examine our values or re-evaluate our priorities.</p>
            <p>Hugh Prather has this quote that i like:</p>
            <p><i>“Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes”.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some examples of how change impacts every field in life:</p>
            <br>
            <p>Business: Many businesses fail because they are unable to adapt to new technology, new ways of doing business, and the constantly changing needs and wants of customers.</p>
            <p>Investing: The same investing strategy that worked 50 years ago may or may not work today, and it’s unlikely that your current investing strategy will be effective for future generations.</p>
            <p>Healthcare: A seasoned doctor with over 30 years of experience cannot prescribe the same medications that were prescribed to patients 20 years ago.</p>
            <p>Education: The same curriculum that I studied when I was in high school most likely won’t be suitable for my children when they turn 14.</p>
            <p>Technology: There’s no need to even describe this; technology is constantly evolving.</p>
            <p>Change must be embraced and welcomed by everyone. It is absolutely necessary to promote progress. I cannot say whether things will improve if we change; what I can say is that they must change if they are to get better.</p>
