            <h2>In It For The Long Term</h2>
            <p>I have zero interest in playing short term games in pretty much everything I do. I don’t like short term investing, short term commitments, short term relationships, short term careers, short term jobs, short term exercising plans etc…And if you are wondering why — its simple — I am a huge believer that a big part of success depends on patience and on giving things enough time to work out to your advantage. <a href="https://medium.com/@liviob/wait-you-win-c683419fbc1d">In a post I wrote</a> a few weeks ago about the importance of time, I mentioned how little improvements and changes don’t have a huge significance in the short run, but when you start factoring in time, these small improvements become life-changing.</p>
            <p>However, let me be very clear about something — just as I believe that most of your success depends on playing the long-term game and being patient, I also believe that time is usually a good indicator that what you are pursuing could easily be a waste of time and effort. Just because you stick with something for a long time does not necessarily mean that what you are doing is the right thing to do.</p>
            <p>The best examples of people who prefer the short-term game are day-traders and short-term investors. Short-term investors view day-trading as less risky because they experience less volatility and want quick profits. In theory, there is nothing wrong with it, even though I personally oppose short-term investing. Short-term investors are attempting to do something a bit different from most investors, and the reason is simple — doing exactly what most people do will yield average results. The problem is, we don’t want the same outcomes as everyone else. We don’t seek average results; we want different, superior results. Different outcomes result from either doing things differently or doing different things. However, I don’t believe that short-term investing is a wise decision.</p>
            <p>Our brains are very attracted to immediate and visible benefits. The short term sometimes means cutting corners, breaking the rules to get to where you want to get faster. Short term means taking advantage of people, using all the resources that are momentarily available to you to “achieve” your goals etc. I hate cutting corners. I think that it just never works. Even if it “works”, it will either be temporary, or a complete illusion.</p>
            <p>The long-term game can sometimes look boring. Who wants to get 8 hours of sleep when everyone else is out partying and staying up late? Who wants to go to the gym when those around you are enjoying junk food? Who wants to go to work when your friends are heading to the beach? Who wants to wake up early to go for a run when everyone else is comfortably sleeping in? If you intend to play the long game, you must be willing to make sacrifices today in order to experience a brighter tomorrow.</p>
            <br>
           <p><i>“Playing the long game — eschewing short-term gratification in order to work toward an uncertain but worthy future goal — isn’t easy. But it’s the surest path to meaningful and lasting success in a world that, so often, prioritizes what’s easy, quick — and ultimately shallow.”</i></p>
