            <h2>Cheap Thrills and Deep Thrills</h2>
            <p>Got inspired to write this post after I finished reading “Your Money or Your Life” by Vicki Robin.</p>
            
            <p>I like to consider cheap thrills as a list of things that “make” us temporarily happy and are a result of external rewards. On the other hand, Deep Thrills are pieces of happiness that turn into fulfillment and they are a result of internal rewards. Cheap thrills are passing, deep thrills are lasting.</p>
            <p>Typically parents who are in love with simple life try to instill their values to their children and later to their grandchildren. However, as much as they try, sometimes they hear their children say that they know what happiness is: “It’s that feeling that you get right after you buy something”.</p>
            <p>Cheap thrills are like that. Temporary pieces of happiness that you get when you buy something that you like, like toys (when you are a kid) or jewelry and cars when you grow older. That happiness rarely lasts. By the time you leave the store and you go home you realize that the widget you purchased had such a short life, that sometimes makes you regret the choice you made. We achieve cheap thrills by pleasing others, winning a competition that we didn't really deserve to win, beating the competition just to make a point, and buying the respect of others.</p>
            <p>Deep thrills are the true joy of life. It is the joy that comes from finally feeling fulfilled, from going from being an uneducated individual to someone who finally possesses a master’s or Ph.D. and has a status in society. It is the feeling that comes from knowing that the career you chose was the right one and that you are finally able to provide for your family. It is the satisfaction that comes from helping someone in need or changing someone’s life for the better. It is the satisfaction that comes from making your parents proud and paying off all the sacrifices they made to make you the person you are today. It is the fulfillment that comes from achieving a lifetime dream and feeling loved by people you care about for who you are and not what you have. This is a real joy in life, a happiness that lasts, moments that you will remember forever.</p>

            <p>Here are some pieces of advice that I have for everyone who can’t distinguish between temporary joy and long-lasting fulfillment:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>If you think that the fancy car or fancy watch will make you happy you are wrong. Happiness is a deep thrill, that you need to work for and can’t be found in widgets.</li>
                <li>If you think that nice commodities, like a nice house, or a nice car (cheap thrills) can buy respect (deep thrill), you are wrong, respect is something that takes years to earn and minutes to lose.</li>
                <li>If you think that people that you care about will love you more (deep thrill) just because you offer them more commodities to be around you (cheap thrill), you are wrong. Attention and love cannot be bought.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Stuff that gives you an instant feeling of fulfillment is not true fulfillment. There is a huge difference between the joy you get from a temporary win and the long-term satisfaction that you get from achieving a dream.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
