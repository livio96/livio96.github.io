            <h2>Earning Respect: Beyond Material Possessions</h2>
            <p>I like to have nice things, and sometimes, even fancy ones. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, as long as I can afford them. However, if there’s something I absolutely cannot accept, it’s the idea that you can use your possessions and your money to buy respect, admiration, and love. That is an impossible task. It will never happen. You might gain some attention (for a short period of time), but you will never earn respect, admiration, and love in this way.</p>
            <p>This isn’t universal, but there are cases when people’s desire to show off fancy stuff is their only, desperate way to gain others’ admiration. They may have nothing else to showcase: wisdom, intelligence, great communication, empathy, kindness, a sense of humor, etc., so they immediately flaunt their possessions, saying, <strong>‘Take a look at my car, my watch, my houses. You see? I am worth it”.</strong></p>
            <p>If your favorite uncle, your mother, your dad, or your siblings went broke, most likely you would feel bad, and you might even try to help them. But it’s almost guaranteed that you wouldn’t think less of them, and you wouldn’t stop admiring, loving, or respecting them. That’s a universal truth that applies to everyone who truly loves or cares about their family and friends. Material wealth may impress, but it won’t command respect. It has a short shelf life. Admiration and respect are not price tags; they are an exact reflection of your actions.</p>
            <p>When I was a child, I didn’t even grasp the concept of money and wealth. I used to admire numerous soccer players, but one, in particular, stood out: Ronaldinho. He was a player I eagerly awaited to see on the field. Naturally, great talent often accompanies substantial wealth, and Ronaldinho was rich, famous, immensely talented, and highly admired by millions of soccer fans.</p>
           <p>Fast forward 15 years, after retiring from soccer, he encountered serious legal issues. He was apprehended in Paraguay for using forged passports, leading to a 32-day prison stay before being placed under a four-month house arrest. During this time, Ronaldinho resided in an opulent Asuncion hotel. Following a thorough investigation, he was eventually released in August 2020. Today, he is officially bankrupt.</p>
           <p>However, the most crucial point to note is that my admiration for him remains unchanged. I still hold the same level of respect for his talent and his unwavering passion for soccer as I did 15 years ago.</p>
           <p>True respect, admiration and love can’t be bought or sold.Once you see people being respected and admired for reasons that have nothing to do with the stuff they own, you realize that they are truly successful and happy. Respect is the echo of our actions, not the jingle of our pockets.</p>
