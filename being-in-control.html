            <h2>Being In Control</h2>
            <p><i>The most significant achievement one can strive for is having control over their life and time. Nothing feels more fulfilling and rewarding than being in charge of what you do throughout the day.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Let me start by giving you a few examples:</p>
            <br></br>
            <ul>
               <li>Camping is fun, but being homeless is miserable. Difference? Camping is a choice, you don't choose to be homeless.</li>
               <li>Taking a walk is fun and healthy, but if you need to walk 6 miles to go to work, that is miserable.</li>
               <li>Surfing social media pages on your smartphone is fun, but being told to surf the internet for 8 hours a day is painful.</li>
               <li>Working all day on your dreams and vision is fulfilling, but working all day to fulfill someone else’s dreams could be rewarding but not fulfilling.</li>
               <li>Waking up early to enjoy the morning sunshine could be a choice, but being told to wake up early to get something done is not pleasant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What do all these have in common? For some of them, you made a choice, and for others, someone else made a choice for you.</p>
            <p>Morgan Housel writes about the highest form of wealth:</p>
            <p><i>“The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.”</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Running a business is hard and for sure entrepreneurship is not meant for everyone. It requires dedication, hard work, commitment, lack of excuses and more importantly an extreme desire to be persistent and consistent even when things are not going your way. However, it is rewarding. What is its biggest reward? Control. You are in charge. You decide what is right and what’s not, what should be done, and what should be ignored. You decide the focus of your own business and the focus of a lot of people who are working alongside you to make your dreams come true.</p>
            <p>When asked about the definition of success the serial entrepreneur and investor Kevin O’Leary said:</p>
            <p><i>“Pursuing money just for the sake of having it: You’ll never get there. That’s the trouble: You never have enough. But in life, you don’t need that much.”</i></p>
            <p>O’Leary went on to explain that while entrepreneurs want to provide for their families, they don’t have to have a flashy car or be covered in diamonds. “That’s greed,” says O’Leary. “Nothing to do with success.”
               He then continued:
               “Having control over your own time is really, in my view, a definition of success.”
            </p>
            <p>Having control over your own time. With these six words, O’Leary teaches a powerful lesson that can be applied to everything we do in life.
               So, whether you’re considering business ownership, long-term investing, or any other way of becoming wealthy, remember that invaluable six-word definition of success: Having control over your own time.
               <br><br>
               Because regardless of how much money you earn, being able to your time is priceless!
            </p>
