        <h2>How do humans make decisions?</h2>
        
        <p>We, humans, tend to ignore facts and data and make most of our decisions by “trusting our gut.” More often than not, people don’t make decisions by looking at a spreadsheet or data charts. The most important decisions in life are made at the dinner table, while going for a walk, or in the shower.</p>
        <p>But why is that? The reason is that humans are emotional creatures, not good at calculating risk or dealing with probability, and incapable of controlling their subconscious mind. Let me give you a few examples to illustrate this better.</p>        
        <p><i>Imagine the typical emotional reaction to seeing a spider: fear and terror.</i> But what is the likelihood of dying from a spider bite? It is estimated that less than three deaths per year occur from spider bites. So the chances of someone dying from a spider bite are 1 in 100 million. There is no data to support the fact that spiders are life-threatening but we are still terrified of them.</p>
        <p><i>Most people are terrified of getting on a plane</i> because they consider flights dangerous and life-threatening. But rarely anyone is scared of driving. Your odds of being in an accident during a flight are one in 1.2 million, and the chances of that accident being fatal are one in 11 million. Conversely, your chances of dying in a car crash are one in 5,000. So how come we are more scared of flights than driving?</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>A survey that was conducted in May 2020 by executive search firm Christian & Timbers reveals that fully 45% of corporate executives now rely more on instinct than on facts and figures in running their businesses.</i></p>
        
        <p>Why do we feel more comfortable trusting our gut than analyzing numbers and charts?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We are emotional creatures, so it's more natural to make decisions based on emotions than numbers.</li>
            <li>Not everybody has an analytical mind.</li>
            <li>It’s a way for you to make fast and effective decisions in unfamiliar, changing, and complex situations.</li>
            <li>It’s more comfortable trusting your instincts, and if you end up being right, it feels better to praise yourself, than praise a spreadsheet or a chart.</li>
            <li>Intuition isn’t just useful for dealing with problems. It’s highly useful for driving creativity and bringing a bit of magic to complex problems that we face every day.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And list goes on and on….</p>
        <br>
        <p>Making good decisions requires concentrated mental effort, data analysis, and some gut-feel magic. So it’s best to balance these components, to improve decision-making, take healthy risks, minimize stress, and most importantly avoid <a target="_blank" href="time-wasting-detector.html"><i>wasting time.</i></a></p>
