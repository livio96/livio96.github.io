        <h2>Time Wasting Detector</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><i>“Time is free, but it’s priceless. You can’t own it, but you can use it. You can’t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you’ve lost it you can never get it back.” — Harvey Mackay</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p>Time is free, but it’s priceless. Such a powerful statement but so easy to overlook. With the number of distractions that surround us everyday, it’s very easy to waste precious time on things that have absolutely no value. </p>
        <p>The question is, is there a way to find out if what you are doing is important or if it’s simply a complete waste of time? And the simple answer is: “It’s not straightforward”. However there are a few questions that you can ask yourself to somewhat determine if what you are doing is not worth it, or it’s not really helping you progress and improve in life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let me share some of these thoughts with you:</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1- Will I care about this 5 years from now?</strong></p>
        <p> We spend so much time scrolling on social media, reading non-sense articles, posts, news that have absolutely no value to us. The question is why? Because they were written by people who get paid to make them attractive and important to you. The question you need to ask yourself is: Will I care about what I’m reading, 5 years from now? Will I care about this activity 5 years from now? And if the answer is NO then I would highly recommend you stop doing it, stop scrolling, and put your phone/tablet/computer away. </p>
        <p><strong>2- Does this help me achieve any of my personal, health, career or financial goals?</strong></p>
        <p> We all attend events, meetings, read lengthy articles and books for hours and hours wasting a lot of precious time, thinking that we are actually making progress or learning something. However, that is not always the case. Ask yourself if what you are doing is helping in any way, shape or form achieve any of the goals that you have set to yourself for the upcoming months, years or decades. And if the answer is NO, then most likely what you are doing may not be worth it.</p>
        <p><strong>3-Does this help me build/cultivate a stronger relationship with someone I care (Family, friends, partner, or relatives)?</strong></p>
        <p> This is simple and straightforward. If watching a game, attending a concert, or enjoying any outdoor activities with your kids, your family or someone you genuinely care about, helps you have a good time and cultivate a healthier and stronger relationship with that person, then you are in the right place. </p>
        <p><strong>4- Is this experience worth remembering?</strong></p>
        <p> There is this quote that I like (which by the way I’m not sure who said it but that is beside the point) <strong>“Life brings tears, smiles, and memories. The tears dry, the smiles fade, but memories last forever.”</strong> Memories are precious so it’s worth having memories that last forever. However, this is extremely personal. If you think that going on a trip, enjoying a nice vacation or doing any other activity that you believe will last long in your memory will make you happy then by all means pursue it. At the end of the day, a good life is a collection of good memories. </p>
        <p>Time wasting is a common problem that many people face in their daily lives. It can affect our productivity, happiness, and health. To stop time wasting and do things that matter, we need to be aware of our habits, set clear goals, prioritize our tasks, and eliminate distractions. By doing so, we can make the most of our time and live a fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>
