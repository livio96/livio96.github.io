            <h2>Are you willing to copy who you admire?</h2>
            <p>Almost guaranteed that everybody, at some point, has followed or will follow a successful person on social media. That is perfectly normal; we should all have a role model. It inspires us to become better. If your passion is investing, most likely you will listen very carefully to Warren Buffett’s investing advice. If your passion is soccer, most likely you will follow Ronaldo or Messi on social media. If your passion is music, then it’s guaranteed you have a picture of your favorite artist in your bedroom. This is perfectly normal behavior, and I really encourage people to find a role model and use their career path for personal inspiration and motivation.</p>
            <p>However, here is something important to point out: The person you admire is not necessarily the person you want to copy. Let me explain why.</p>
            <p>Most of these successful people are a true inspiration to most of us, but what we don’t see is the fact that their enormous success came at an enormous cost. Warren Buffett is the greatest investor of all time and is admired by even the most successful people on the planet. But here is an interesting fact: when the book ‘The Snowball’ came out, a biography written about Buffett by an author named Alice Schroeder, it explained that Buffett did not live a perfect life by any means. Actually, the complete opposite: his personal life was a complete disaster. Everyone is human, and humans don’t live a perfect life, so that is totally fine. However, the gap between his investing career success and his personal life success is huge. It’s such a huge gap that I truly believe most of us wouldn’t accept.</p>
            <p>Success doesn’t come in a vacuum. Success comes in a package — in a package full of ups and downs, bad days and good days, inspiration and discouragement, happiness and sadness, smiles and tears, assurance and uncertainty, joy and sorrow, fulfillment and discontent, trust and distrust. We have to be willing to take it all. Just like we admire our role model’s success story, we need to be able to admire and accept the other side of the coin. They go hand in hand. I’ve never met someone who wouldn’t want to be happy, successful, and important. I’ve never met someone who doesn’t say, ‘One day I want to become like that successful person.’ The question is, are you willing to do what it takes to get there? Are you willing to pay the price?</p>
            <p>The people you admire are admired by most because of their career success, not necessarily because of their life success. They are both extremely important, and it’s for you to decide what matters more. You — and only you — get to decide what success means to you, what success you actually want to achieve, and what success you want to avoid. The only thing we know for a fact is that one doesn’t come without the other. So the next time you admire someone, ask yourself if you are willing to copy them.</p>
