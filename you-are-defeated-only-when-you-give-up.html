            <h2>You Are Defeated Only When You Give Up.</h2>
            <p>I am going to briefly describe the life of someone who no longer lives:</p>
            <p>He was born in extreme poverty, and was kicked out of his home when he was young. He failed on his first time in business, and the second time he failed even worse. He tried to start a political career, but failed miserably in the first few attempts and got fired twice. Later in life, he tried to become a state senator spokesperson but failed again. In subsequent elections he failed six more times and he got fired again…..</p>
            <p>Now let me ask you what you think of this person already? Let me guess — What a loser! A complete failure and you are probably even questioning the reason he even tried so hard when he failed so many times to begin with. Well let me tell you that the person I just described is Abraham Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Abraham Lincoln was the greatest hero of the last two centuries. In my opinion no one is greater than Lincoln in the history of the United States. He did amazing things for this country and after so many failures, he he succeeded in becoming the most succesful President of the United States. Wait but how come he made it? How did he find the courage to continue after so many failures? — Simple — Abraham Lincoln never stopped trying. He never gave up. Everyone has gone through failures in life and experienced a mental setback but very few can be as resilient as Lincoln. After every failed attempt, he used to push himself by saying: “This is just a slip up, not as if I’m dead and unable to get up”. In his mind, only death could stop him from wanting to achieve his goals and that is exactly what happened.</p>
            <p>Lincoln’s story is just an example. There are a ton of great examples like this that motivate me personally and should motivate you too. Success is a series of struggles and setbacks. Most people who succeeded, failed at least once, but they finally made it. Why? Because of their persistence. Lincoln’s life is a great example of turning setbacks into a real success.</p>
            <p>I am not trying to judge anyone for giving up on their dream. Life happens, and if you decide to give up, then it’s okay, but at least give it another try. Keeping the ‘one more try’ principle in the back of your mind will prevent you from giving up many times throughout your life. One more rep at the gym, one more chance in your relationship, one more attempt to fix something that just broke, one more try when you fail at something new — just one more, one more, one more. Giving it another shot will likely get you there</p>
            <p>Use Lincoln’s life story to inspire yourself. If we all keep doing that, our big winning day will come.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
