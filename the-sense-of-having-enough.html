            <h2>The Sense of Having Enough</h2>
            <p><i>“Never risk what you have and need,” wrote Warren Buffett, “for what we don’t have and don’t need.”</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>In pursuit of our goals, we inevitably give up things that matter. We sleep less. We eat unhealthily. We sacrifice our physical, social, and mental health for material wealth.</p>
            <p>Let me share with you a parable that when I read for the first time, really taught me a lesson. Here we go….</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>An American investment banker was taking a much-needed vacation in a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. The boat had several large, fresh fish in it. Impressed by the quality of the fish, the investment banker greeted the fisherman and asked how long it took to catch them.<br>
               The fisherman replied, &ldquo;Only a little while.&rdquo;. The banker then asked why he didn&rsquo;t stay out longer and catch more fish. To which the fisherman responded that he had enough to support his family&rsquo;s immediate needs.
            </i></p>
            <p><i>A bit confused, the banker questioned, &ldquo;So what do you do with the rest of your time?&rdquo;</i></p>
            <p><i>The fisherman answered, &ldquo;I sleep in, do a little fishing in the morning, play with my children and take a siesta with my wife in the afternoon, then I stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my friends. I have a full and busy life.</i></p>
            <p><i>The investment banker scoffed, &ldquo;I have an MBA from Harvard and I think I can help you out. If you spent more time fishing you could sell more fish and buy a bigger boat. With a bigger boat, you can sell even more fish and with those proceeds buy several more boats until, eventually, you would have a whole fleet of fishing boats. And instead of selling to a middleman, you could sell directly to the processor and in time open your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution.&rdquo;</i></p>
            <p><i>He then added, &ldquo;Of course, you would need to leave this small fishing village and move to a bigger market like Mexico City where you could grow your enterprise.&rdquo;</i></p>
            <p><i>The fisherman asked, &ldquo;Ok, but how long will all of this take?&rdquo;</i></p>
            <p><i>&ldquo;Around 15 to 20 years,&rdquo; said the banker.</i></p>
            <p><i>&ldquo;Alright, and then what?&rdquo; asked the fisherman.</i></p>
            <p><i>&ldquo;Then you can sell the company and make millions&ldquo; &mdash; the banker replied.</i></p>
            <p><i>&ldquo;Millions?? That sounds nice. But what would I do after that?&rdquo; inquired the fisherman.</i></p>
            <p>The investment banker responded simply, &ldquo;Then you retire.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><i>&ldquo;You move to a small coastal fishing village where you could sleep in late, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, and stroll into the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play guitar with your friends.&rdquo;<i></p>
            <br>
            
            <p>The parable teaches us that sacrificing our time and other important things for something that may not be important is foolish. It takes a lot of self-awareness and analysis to understand when we are in a ‘good enough’ position, but most people don’t do it. If we all took a step back and thought about the position we are in and how much we are sacrificing daily for things that don’t matter much, we would all live better and healthier lives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Let me end this post with one last quote by Lao Tzu:</p>
            <p><i><strong>“He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough”</strong></i></p>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
