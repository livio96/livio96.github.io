            <h2>You May Be Busy But Maybe Not Productive</h2>
            <p>In today’s world, computers and machines accomplish in seconds what used to take us weeks or months. We used to wash clothes by hand; now, washing machines complete the task in 30 minutes while allowing us to focus on other activities. Communication has become significantly faster today compared to 50 years ago — an email takes seconds to send, whereas in the past, it would take weeks for a letter to reach the intended recipient. Despite the numerous technological innovations that have saved us a substantial amount of time, surveys indicate that today, we feel busier than ever. Most people I talk to say that they don’t have time to do what the like to do. They struggle to find time to spend with their children or engage in things they enjoy, such as outdoor activities, reading books, learning new things etc.</p>
            <h3>So what is the real issue, why do we feel like we are busier than before?</h3>
            <p>Statistics show that we spend fewer hours in the office than in the early 1950s. We also work less time from home, yet we still feel busy.
            <br>The simple explanation I have come up with is this: Technology has provided us with more free time, but unfortunately, we are using that time to keep ourselves busy. I want to make something clear here — the free time resulting from technological innovations is being used in the most unproductive way possible, which is why we feel extremely busy. So, it is true that we are busier, but certainly not more productive.</p>
            <p>Let me provide you with a good example: Try having a conversation with a teenager today. Ask them about their day, and most likely, they will tell you about going to school in the morning, perhaps having a part-time job at a coffee shop in the afternoon, and then being free. Now, pay close attention to how they spend their free time, and I can almost guarantee you that more than 70% of it is spent flipping between Instagram, email, news apps, video games, and other activities that are not fulfilling. Before realizing it, it’s 10 PM, and they need to go to bed to prepare for the next day at school.</p>
            <p>Distraction today is effortless, and all generations are suffering from it. It’s so easy to get lost in the world of fake entertainment and other nonsense that doesn’t lead anywhere. While technology has made our jobs easier, it has also made distraction so effortless, giving us the feeling that we don’t have time for anything. As Mason Cooley once said, ‘The time I kill is killing me.’</p>
            <p>Multitasking in a world where technology is improving exponentially fast is easy, but we are the ones who choose what to multitask on. Are we being productive by multitasking and solving real-life problems, or are we multitasking to make ourselves busier and less productive? That’s a question that everyone needs to answer for themselves.</p>
            <br>
