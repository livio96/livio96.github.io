            <h2>Social Comparison</h2>
            <p><i>“Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not To Who Someone Else Is Today” — Jordan Peterson</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Social comparison theory is the idea that individuals determine their own social and personal worth based on how they stack up against others.</p>
           
            <p>There is that saying, If you want to feel rich, start hanging out with poor people, and if you want to feel poor, start hanging out with rich people. This explains how most people measure their wealth, well-being, and success. Constantly comparing ourselves to other individuals has absolutely no positive impact on us. Actually, all that produces, is unhappiness and envy.</p>
            
            <p>In his great book, The Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel writes:</p>

            <p><i>“Social comparison is the problem here. It’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with — to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you. Life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations”</i></p>
            <p>Comparing yourself and your income to others can change your outlook on how well you are doing financially. Here is a simple example that illustrates this:</p>
            <p>Someone making $100,000 a year might be considered rich if they are 18 years old, but not if they are 50. That same individual who is making $100k living in NYC is not considered rich by any means, but in comparison to the rest of the world, he is in the top 10%.</p>
            <p>Let me close this post with one last quote by Morgan Housel:</p>
            <p><i>“The ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it”</i></p>
