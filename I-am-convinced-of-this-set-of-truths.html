            <h2>I am convinced of this set of truths</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>How you do anything is how you do everything.</li>
              <li>Taking a step back to rethink looks like is slowing you down, but continuing in the wrong path, will slow you down 10x more.</li>
              <li>If you have to choose between time and money, choose the first. Money can be remade, time cannot.</li>
              <li>You will change, and not necessarily because you want to but because the world around you changes.</li>
              <li>The best part of a plan is plan B.</li>
              <li>Never risk something you have and you need for something that you don’t have and don’t need.</li>
              <li>There is no overnight success but for sure there is overnight failure.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.mentalliquidity.com/top-2-financial-strategies.html">Top 2 financial strategies</a>: Live below your means, and don’t try to impress anyone.</li>
              <li>Be careful what you consider a good advice. Not everyone is playing the same game as you.</li>
              <li>Consider yourself to be a genius, if you can do the average thing when everyone else around you is losing his mind.</li>
              <li>You will really get to know someone, when you will see how they react in a stressful situation.</li>
              <li>The easy way is always more costly.</li>
              <li>Always be aware of hidden costs, cause those are the hardest to calculate.</li>
              <li>Most important decision in life : who you marry.</li>
              <li>Best inventions happen when nobody is paying attention.</li>
              <li>Sometimes the “laziest” time of the day can turn out to be the most productive. Enhanced creativity kicks in when your mind is clear.</li>
