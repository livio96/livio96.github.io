            <h2>The system is the goal.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>James Clear writes <i>“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your system”</i></p>
            <p>Let me explain why I find this statement so fascinating and why I think goals are a little overrated.</p>
            <p>First, let me define both: Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the way that leads to those results.</p>
            <p>If you are a musician, your goal is to make your music go viral. If you are a football coach, your goal is to win the NFL. There is nothing special about that; everybody wants that. The truth is that winners and losers have the same goals. So why is it that some people achieve their goals while others don’t? The answer to this is very complex, but if I had to summarize it in one sentence, the answer would be “because different people follow different systems to achieve the same goal.” So the key to achieving your goals is the way you go about achieving them.</p>
            <p>In his book “Atomic Habits” James Clear raises a very interesting concern: “If you completely ignored your goals and focused on your system, would you still succeed?” And the simple answer is, most likely yes.</p>
            <p>Just to be clear, goals are not useless by any means. They are very important to give us direction. However, goals without a good system to help achieve them mean absolutely nothing. The goal is the direction, and the process is the best way to make progress towards that goal.</p>
            <p>Scott Adams writes in his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win:</p>
            <p><i>“A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal”.
            </i></p>
            <p>And then he gives a few examples:</p>
            <p><i>The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most human endeavors. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system.</i></p>
            <br>
         </main>
            <p>Let me add a few more examples:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Becoming the CEO of a company is a goal, but working your way up there and earning people’s trust is a system.</li>
                <li>Finding a good partner in life is the goal, but becoming good enough to deserve a good partner is a system.</li>
                <li>Saving and investing for retirement is a goal, but having a career that you love and you don’t want to retire from is a system.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Goals are useful for planning your progress, but systems are more effective for actually making progress. That's why I genuinely believe that the system is the goal.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
