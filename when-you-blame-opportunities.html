            <h2>When You Blame Opportunities.</h2>
            <p>Here is an important decision you can make — “Stop playing the Blame Game”.</p>
           <p>How many things go wrong in your life every day? What if you don’t accept what’s happening, and you start blaming the economy, the government, the schools, the teachers, the marketplace, the company you work for, your boss, your co-workers, your car insurance policy, and the list goes on and on…? Something did not go your way, and all of a sudden, you have a list of things to blame.</p>
           <p>I am guilty of this myself. It was so easy for me, just as it is for every human being, to blame others, to blame the system, to blame bad luck for everything that went wrong. In all fairness, it makes sense — Who wants to be hard on oneself anyway? Who wants to admit being wrong?</p>
           <p>Darren Hardy has this great quote that I like:</p>
           <p><i>“The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.”</i></p>
           <p>I had to change my thinking and my mindset. I was so confused about what was causing my problems. Once I stopped blaming the government, taxes, things that cost too much, bad friends, bad relatives, and started focusing on the real problem — which was me — my life got exponentially better.</p>
           <p>Changing your mindset, starting to take on responsibility, and holding yourself accountable is hard because it means you have to change yourself. You have to change who you are. A few years ago, I heard a good friend of mine blaming his parents for being broke after he graduated college: ‘They never taught me how to manage money and never taught me the importance of personal finance’. To an extent, this is a good point — learning how to manage money at an early age is helpful, but can you really blame your past for a bad present? Absolutely not. It doesn’t matter how dark your past was; you can always make your future brighter.</p>
           <p>In his book excellent <strong>“The Art of Exceptional Living”</strong> Jim Rohn considers stopping the Blame Game, as a necessary change in your life’s philosophy:</p>
           <p><i>"“Once I change my life philosophy, my income changed. immediately. Immediately my whole life took on a whole new look and color. The early results from making these philosophical changes tasted so good that I’ve never stopped the process from that day until this. With a little consideration of setting a better sail and refining your philosophy, your whole life can start to change starting today. You don’t have to wait until tomorrow. You can start this whole process immediately.</i></p>
           <p>Here are a few examples of things that you hear and say everyday that you can start changing immediately to improve your life:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Instead of saying “My problem is that everything costs too much”, say “The real problem is that I can’t afford it”</li>
             <li>Instead of saying “My work environment is the worst” say “i picked the wrong work environment”</li>
             <li>Instead of saying “Nobody understands my situation” say “Maybe i put myself in a situation that it’s hard to understand”</li>
             <li>Instead of saying “I am not being compensated fairly at work because my boss is cheap” say “Maybe I need to work for someone else who will compensate me fairly, or improve my skillset to be able to make more money”</li>
             <li>Instead of saying “I am always on the wrong side of luck” say “It’s okay to be on the wrong side of luck, how can I do approach things differently to balance things out”</li>
           </ul>
