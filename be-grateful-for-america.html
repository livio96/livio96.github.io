            <h2>Be Grateful For America.</h2>
            <p>I listen to many podcasts and read a lot of books, primarily about economy and personal finance and all I have been listening to recently is how America’s future is not promising. How everything is “going to hell” and how other countries are building stronger economies.</p>
            <p>All i am going to emphasize in this short article, is that we all need to be thankful for what we already have. If you live in the US, everything you ever need is available here. People from other countries want to come here, or better said, dream to come here. All the music you need, schools you need, training you need, books you need, malls you need, vacations you need, markets you need, opportunities you need, information you need and freedom you need — everything is available here. Being ungrateful and cynic blinds you from seeing USA for what it already is: an absolutely blessing and a world full of opportunities.</p>
           <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
            <p>The perception of whether or not a country is a good place to live can vary greatly depending on individual preferences, circumstances, and perspectives. What makes a country “good” to live in is subjective and can differ from person to person. However, there are several factors that have historically contributed to America’s appeal as a place to live for many people: economic opportunities, educational opportunities, cultural diversity, freedom, democracy, quality of life, natural beauty, innovation, technology and a wonderful variety of culture.</p>
            <p>I am not trying to turn this into a political speech, or trying to convince anyone that America is the best country in the world. Everyone is free to live wherever they feel good and safe. The whole point of this is to emphasize that we need to be grateful for what we have and most people need to take a step back and think about what opportunity they are given in life. Nothing is perfect, and nothing that’s worth pursuing is easy — but complaining about something that you should be grateful for blindsights you, and last thing you are going to be able to see will be the fact that you live a reality that for most people in the world is a dream that may never come true.</p>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I read a survey that stated the United States is not even in the top 10 happiest countries in the world. People were debating whether this is a result of how stressful life in the US is. In all honesty, I do agree with that. Living in America could be stressful, but I would argue by asking: “Is there something in life that is worth living or pursuing that is not challenging and stressful?” I wrote an article a few days ago about <a href="https://medium.com/@liviob/the-real-cost-of-an-easy-job-1c6cf2796de7">how easy things are costly</a>, and I stand by it.</p>
            <p>To everyone on social media, YouTube, Spotify, and other online platforms: “Let’s shift our attention away from the drawbacks of our country and instead appreciate the privilege of being a part of it. Your seemingly ‘ordinary and uneventful’ life is the aspiration of millions just like you.”</p>
