            <h2>The Real Cost of an Easy Job</h2>
            <p>I tend to believe that the true cost of our actions is hidden. Often i like to call it uncalculated cost. When we buy something, we immediately look at the price tag and boom — thats our cost. Thats our direct cost. Thats the cost that we are all familiar with. However, what if i told you that very often, our actions and choices in life have other hidden costs, that sometimes are way more ‘expensive’ than the cost that we can lay out in a spreadsheet.</p>
            <p>Let me explain something that i’m pretty sure about.</p>
            <p>We spend most of our day at work- let's say 8–10 hours a day. Thats literally 1/3 of the day. If your job is not productive and challenging, that means that a third of the day is not productive or challenging. Another 1/3 of the day you spend sleeping, and the final third, on entertainment or other commitments where you may or may not have to use any brain power. Thats why a mentally challenging job is essential to your overall mental training and thought process improvement.</p>
            <p>A life without purpose, goals, battles, struggle is not a life worth living. I am willing to make a bet and I will stand by it for the rest of my life. At least 25%–30% of the workforce in every corporate in America collects a paycheck by either doing basically no work, or working a third of the time they are supposed to work. At the end of the day, who wouldn’t want to make money while browsing the internet or playing video games all day?</p>
            <p>The truth is that this is mentally and physically destructive to humans. On top of that, every second that you spend on something that is not fulfilling to you is a second that you do not spend on something that feels fulfilling. We all need a paycheck to cover our basic needs and pay our bills, but doing that at the expense of your overall professional and mental improvement is a big mistake.</p>
            <p>I always keep this principle at the forefront of my thoughts, and I’m committed to one day passing to my children and grandchildren: The easy way has hidden cost, hidden cost that will very soon become obvious and will cause tremendous amount of sadness, regret and lack of fulfillment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
