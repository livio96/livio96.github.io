            <h2>Mental Liquidity</h2>
            
            <p>I recently came across the term &ldquo;Mental Liquidity&rdquo; as I was listening to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2l01lGyIh9xodneIV37dD3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Morgan Housel Podcast on Spotify</a>, and it really got me thinking.</p>
            <p>Mental Liquidity is the ability to change your mind or break some of your old beliefs as you acquire new information or learn new things.
               Some ideas, beliefs, and knowledge that most people acquire throughout their lives play a major role in the way they live and build relationships. Unfortunately, these beliefs are very hard to change throughout your life for several different reasons:
            </p><br>
            <ol>
               <li><strong>Most people are typically not comfortable with change, including changes in lifestyle, career, and daily routines.</strong></li>
               <li><strong>Admitting that you have been wrong about something for many years is a very hard pill to swallow.</strong></li>
               <li><strong>Being right just makes you feel good.</strong></li>
           </ol>
           <p>>In her excellent book&nbsp;<em>Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error</em>, Kathryn Schulz states:</span></p>
           <p>><em>&ldquo;A whole lot of us go through life assuming that we are basically right, basically all the time, about basically everything: our political and intellectual convictions, our religious and moral beliefs, our assessment of other people, our memories, our grasp of facts. As absurd as it sounds when we stop to think about it, our steady state seems to be one of unconsciously assuming that we are very close to omniscient.&rdquo;</em></span></p>
           <p>><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Reflecting on how some of the strong beliefs that you had in the past (which apparently happened to be wrong) negatively impacted your life and your relationships with your family, friends, and co-workers is a very tedious and exhausting process that often results in a huge amount of regret.</strong></span></p>
           <p>>When railways first came into being, it was stated that they obviously would not work because if the human body was propelled at a speed of over 40 miles per hour, the brains would leak out of the ears. Surprisingly enough, this was a belief that most people had for many years, which kept them away from enjoying the convenience of one of the most common forms of transportation that we use today all around the world.</span></p>
           <p>>Having a strong belief makes you feel you are right. Thinking you are right makes you feel good and happy about yourself. Feeling good and happy is the ultimate goal that every human being has; that&rsquo;s what makes beliefs hard to change, even though facts show the opposite.</span></p>
           <p>>Mental liquidity is crucial for handling the uncomfortable experience of admitting mistakes, facing their consequences, and making amends by staying receptive to new information and using it to your advantage.</span></p>
           <p>>Thanks for reading!</span></p>
