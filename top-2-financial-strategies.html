           <h2>Top 2 Financial Strategies</h2>
            <p>I am not a financial advisor, and I don’t have a Phd in finance, so for sure I am not the most adequate person to give any financial advice to anyone. Howeer one thing that I know about myself is that I have spend thousands of hours of my life in the last 10 years reading about personal finance, saving and investing. Regardless of what I read I realized that building wealth and becoming financially stable comes down to two essential financial strategies. Obviously there is hundreds of financial strategies that can help you build wealth but there are two in particular that I truly believe in.</p>
            <h3>1. Live below your means.</h3>
            <p>This sounds very simple and trivial but for some reason is a very difficult financial strategy to implement for most Americans. Surveys show that low-income consumers, or those earning less than $50,000 annually, living paycheck to paycheck increased from 74% in July 2022 to 78% in July 2023. Among high-income consumers, 13% struggle to pay monthly bills, up sharply from 8.8% in July 2022.</p>
            <p>This is mainly happening because life got a lot more expensive but as crazy as it sounds, most of the spending in American households is absolutely unnecessary. Unnecessary stuff, expensive vacations, new cars every 2 years, a lot of credit card debt from uncontrolled spending etc etc — spending that one way or another could be controlled but for some reason most people can’t do it.</p>
            <p>How can living below your means be achieved? Sometimes it’s hard especially if your income is low, but it’s mostly a matter of keeping your expectations in check and not spending on unnecessary things. Independence, at any income level, is driven by your savings rate.</p>
            <h3>2. Stop trying to impress anyone.</h3>
            <p>Many of us likely know someone who is financially well-off, whether it’s a wealthy friend or neighbor. Sometimes, we struggle to manage our emotions and feel compelled to keep up with them, even when our own financial circumstances don’t permit it. This may stem from our ego or a desire to portray ourselves as something we’re not. However, it’s essential to recognize that trying to keep up with others in terms of spending can lead to financial disaster.</p>
            <p>Morgan Housel has this quote that I Like:</p>
            <p><i>"Don’t attempt to keep up with the Joneses without realizing the Joneses aren’t any happier than you are."</i></p>
            <p>Attempting to gain someone’s respect or admiration by showcasing expensive possessions like a fancy car or an expensive watch, even when it strains your finances, is absolutely foolish. It’s better to maintain humility, manage your expenses wisely, and, above all, avoid pretending to be someone your financial situation cannot support.</p>
