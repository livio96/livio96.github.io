            <h2>A Conservative Approach</h2>
            <p>Just heard a great story: </p>
            <p>A dad played a game with his son every week: “here is a dime and a nickel”. Pick one. He took the nickel every single time. His brother told him he’s crazy because the dime is worth more. The kid responded: “No, because if I pick the dime dad will stop playing this game.”</p>            
            <p>The story above is a simple example of a very conservative approach, to be able to stay in the game for a long period of time. This is a life lesson. Too much risk can be rewarding but it can also be catastrophic. Sometimes, if endurance and longevity is your goal, then a conservative approach may be the best choice. It is almost impossible for anyone to predict the future successfully and so this principle advises you to lean towards the more conservative side of any transaction.</p>
            <p>Here is another example: In his early days as CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates said:</p>
            <p><i>"I came up with this incredibly conservative approach that I wanted to have enough money in the bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we didn’t get any payments coming in. I’ve been almost true to that the whole time."</i></p>
            <p>As successful as Microsoft was, the CEO of the largest tech company in the world did not want to take a chance so he played it safe to make sure that if something unexpected happened, he would still stay in business and endure hard times.</p>
            <p>Predicting the unpredictable is an impossible task. You are not able to predict how the economy is going to do in the next few years, almost nobody can. Most likely you will not be able to predict life-changing events like 9/11, the 2008 economic crash or Covid 19. So what is it that you can do to deal with the unexpected? Play it safe. Be conservative, and sometimes even paranoid or pessimistic.</p>
            <p>Just to be clear: This does not mean that you should not take risks in life or try new things. We’ve all heard the saying, “The bigges risk is doing nothing”. However, as Warren Buffet once said “Risking something you have and you need, for something that you don’t have and don’t need is absolutely foolish”.</p>
            <p>Take enough risk to be able to grow, both professionally and financially. However, always make sure that you have a plan B and a safety net.</p>
