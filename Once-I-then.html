        <h2>Once I....then....</h2>
        <p>“If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.” ― <strong>Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Once I get that job then I will be happy. Once I get married then I will feel fulfilled. Once I save X dollars then I'll be financially stable….</p>
        <p>You probably heard the saying — “You plan, God laughs”. Predicting the future is extremely difficult because most of your future could easily be out of our control.Many of us live in the future and forget to live the present. We all have desires, goals, dreams but sacrificing the present, thinking that what the future holds is what will make you happy and make you feel complete, is absolutely foolish.</p>
        <p>At a young age, I had this obsession with planning the next 10 years of my life. I wanted to be in control. I wanted to have a vision for my life and a clear and concise plan for my career and my relationships. The truth is, very soon I realized that most of the time, life doesn’t go according to plan. I learned the hard way that if you are constantly chasing the future, the future never arrives. Every time you think you are getting there, the goalpost moves a little further, and you end up feeling discouraged, lost, and without direction.</p>
        <p>One of the most obvious examples of life not going according to plan is college education. Data shows that only 21% of college graduates use most of/all of their education in their work/career. 70% of the workforce is actively looking for a change in career because they believe that the career they picked after they graduated high-school does not suit them anymore. The average number of jobs for a lifetime on average is 12, and statistics show that 60% of them are not even related to each other.</p>
        <p>The truth is that there are no predictable paths in life. People need to stay open to chance and the unexpected because risk and luck play a major role in our lives. So just stop regreting the past, or worry about the future. The truth is that you can only control so much in life, and overvaluing the present increases the chances of control.</p>
