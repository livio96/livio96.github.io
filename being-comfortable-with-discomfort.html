            <h2>Being Comfortable With Discomfort</h2>
            <p><i>Gary Vaynerchuck has a quote that I like: “If you see a leader going kind when things get tough, you’ve got the right leader”.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Notice how he emphasizes the word leader. Dealing with uncomfortable situations requires patience, empathy, understanding, good communication, and more importantly, trust in the people that surround you. These are typically the most important traits of a leader.</p>
            <p>I like to think of uncomfortable situations or challenges as life lessons. The only time when you are actually growing is when you are uncomfortable. If everything is too good, you are probably stuck. Think of the most valuable skills or lessons that you have learned in life. They were all very tough to even think about. That very first time you tried to swim, the first tough conversation with your parents or friends, your first job, your first date, your first layoff, the first time you saw yourself in debt, and the first time you struggled financially to pay your rent or mortgage. All these tough situations really taught you important lessons that you will carry with you for the rest of your life.</p>
            <p>Dr. Elizabeth Lombardo, Psychologist and author of Better Than Perfect, says people who regularly seek out fresh experiences tend to be more creative and emotionally resilient than those who remain stuck in routine. “Breaking your own mold can only make you stronger and more confident to reach higher levels in your professional and personal life,” she says.</p>
            <p>When you face a challenge, something you are not used to, or something unexpected, you are required to change. You are also required to go push through your limits, develop new skills, and create new perspectives.</p>
            <p>Here are a few quotes that describe the importance of discomfort in personal and professional growth:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
               <li>“Be not afraid of discomfort. If you can’t put yourself in a situation where you are uncomfortable, then you will never grow. You will never change. You’ll never learn. “ - Jason Reynolds</li>
               <li>“The more you practice tolerating discomfort, the more confidence you’ll gain in your ability to accept new challenges” - Amy Morin</li>
               <li>“I love discomfort. I mean, my whole life is discomfort. One reason I can never retire is that the idea of just sitting on the beach totally comfortable is not a desideratum in my life. I like ambiguity, I like conflict, and I like uncertainty” Alan Dershowitz</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And this is from me:</p>
            <h3>If you master discomfort, you can master just about anything!</h3>
