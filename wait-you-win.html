            <ul>
                <li>If someone came to you and said that he would help you get 1% better at something, would you be thrilled? Most likely no.</li>
                <li>If your boss came to you and said that he is giving you a 1% raise, would you get excited? Probably, but for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>If a fund manager guaranteed a 1% return on your investment would you jump for joy? 100% sure you wouldn’t.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now let me slightly rephrase those questions and see if I get different answers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If someone came to you and said that he would help you get 1% better at something <strong>every single day</strong> would you be thrilled? I’m sure you would.</li>
                <li>If your boss came to you and said that he is giving you a 1% raise <strong>every month</strong>, would you jump for joy? Most likely yes.</li>
                <li>If a fund manager guaranteed a 1% return on your investments <strong>every month</strong>, would you take that deal? 100% sure you would.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Little improvements and changes don't have a huge significance in the short run, but when you start factoring in time, these small improvements become life-changing. That is the true power of time. To really notice the power of time, investing is the perfect example. In Investing, time is a key factor. Here is an example:</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
            <p>Warren Buffett is a skilled investor who is studied, analyzed, and imitated by many but the “secret” to Buffett’s immense wealth is simply “how long he’s been investing”, writes Morgan Housel in his amazing book “The Psychology of Money.” Buffett isn’t the greatest of investor of all time when measured by average returns — but he’s had time and patience on his side. The billionaire is an edge case, of course, but the power of compounding can create sufficient wealth for any investor willing to wait.</p>
            <p>Let me put this into a principle/equation and Darren Hardy, in his book, “The Compound Effect” has the perfect one:</p>
            <p><i>Small, smart choices + consistency + <strong>time</strong> = radical difference</i></p>
            <p>Notice a key component in this equation. <strong>Time. Time is your friend!</strong> Time is the most important component in achieving anything. Every “overnight success” that people see (other than hitting the lottery) is an accumulation of small steps, that were repeated consistently over a long time, creating something amazing that we all admire.</p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite quotes about time, and its role in self-improvement, wealth, and happiness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Just because things are taking time, it doesn’t mean that they won’t happen.” — A.J Winters</li>
                <li>“Truth is, great things take time. So, either you wait or you settle for less.” — Unknown</li>
                <li>“You only need to take a series of tiny steps, consistently, over time, to radically improve your life.” — Darren Hardy</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>And my favorite one:</p>
            <p>“No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.” — Warren Buffett</p>
