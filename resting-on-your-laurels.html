            <h2>Resting on your laurels.</h2>
            <p>Resting on your past achievements is one of the easiest paths to future failure and I am fully convinced of this.</p>
           <p>A good doctor doesn’t stop studying after graduation. Actually, it’s the complete opposite. A good doctor studies even more throughout their life to stay updated and keep up with the latest changes in healthcare. A good athlete needs to train every day. In sports, they often say: “You are only as good as your last performance.” An athlete has to constantly perform well. There is no such thing as “past success is enough.” It can’t be enough, and it will never be enough. A champion’s mindset means that success is not defined by a single victory. The same thing applies to business too — a company can’t just sit back and rest on its laurels — they have to move on to something new. In a world that’s rapidly changing. last year’s revenue and innovation will mean absolutely nothing 10 years from now.</p>
           <h3>Congrats on your past success… but you must still learn, improve, and perform.</h3>
           <br>
           <p>Past success can be deceiving. It can trap you in a way that you can’t even predict. After one or many years of successful achievements, all of a sudden, you start believing that you are unbreakable and that every past success will be continuously rewarded in the future. That’s when most people fail. In today’s world, where everything is so competitive, it’s hard to stop learning and improving. It’s a license to failure. Access to the internet and information has given your competition so much power that it’s practically impossible not to feel threatened even when you are outperforming everyone</p>
           <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein once said: <i>“Resting on your laurels is as dangerous as resting when you are walking in the snow. You doze off and die in your sleep”</i>.</p>
           <p>Here is a quick example: Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time, and he started investing when he was 10 years old. However, the truth is that the vast majority of his net worth came in his elderly years. The point is that if Buffett had retired at age 60, like a normal person might, no one would have ever heard of him, even though he was a successful investor for about 50 years. All of his success came in his 70s, 80s, and early 90s. Buffett never took anything for granted; he kept chasing his passion for investing and did not even think about how successful he was in the past.</p>
           <p>It’s great to talk about how good things are now and how good things were in the past, but we can’t sit on our laurels and expect that our time will sustain itself if we don’t do a better job every single day. That’s just how the world works. Being a better version of yourself every day requires underestimating how much you improved in the past and overestimating how much you will improve and change in the future. This is the main reason why I don’t believe in a “retirement age.” I believe that an individual retires when they truly believe that they have stopped contributing to the world and the people around them.</p>
           <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
