            <h2>You Will Believe About Anything</h2>
            <p>Let me make a statement: You will believe about anything that you are told, if it sounds convincing enough.</p>
            <p>Not sure when or where I read this but I really liked the following example: They say that if one person informs you that there is a Lion walking around the neighborhood, you will probably ignore it. If a second person says the same thing, you will start thinking about it. If a third person repeats it, you will actually believe it and run away.</p>
            <p>If you live in a big city, such as New York City or San Francisco, try a small experiment. Stand on a busy street corner and look at the sky. Make sure you invite 2–3 more people to join you in looking at the sky. Keep gazing at the sky for a few minutes for absolutely no real reason, and you will notice that another 2–3 people will join you, and they will start looking at the sky as well. Continue doing this, and I can almost guarantee that in a matter of a few minutes, a crowd of people will be looking at the sky with you, without even knowing why they are doing so to begin with.</p>
<p>The moral of these example is simple: We are wired to do what other people close to us do. We are wired to believe things they believe, and act the way they act. If you hear a lie or a false statement over and over again for a long period of time, you will start believing it. You will start believing that the lie you just heard is true.</p>
<p>According to marketing experts, the average person sees between 4,000 and 10,000 ads in a single day. Does that sound outrageously high? Take a moment to consider it. Every other post on social media is an ad. We are literally bombarded every day with marketing content, some of which may be relevant while others are irrelevant to us. The main purpose of these ads is simple: to make you start thinking about something that didn’t even cross your mind a few minutes ago. After encountering a few of these ads, boom — most likely, you will end up purchasing something you didn’t even plan to buy, or you will read a story or statement that could easily be false but will certainly get you thinking</p>
<p>When we feel insecure, unsure about our reality, or if we have a lot of unanswered question we tend to believe that other people, who are maybe be “smarter” than us, have solutions or answers for us.</p>
<p>The point is that it is very easy to be drawn into a fallacy. Staying alert and having a good filter for fallacies is a life-changing skill. This applies to investing, personal finance, health, psychology, lifestyle, relationships, and pretty much any other field that impacts our lives. Being well-educated, disciplined, and having great common sense are the ‘cure’ to this issue. Stop believing everything you read or hear, and start using your judgment to come up with meaningful conclusions before you take any action. Always remember that different people, in different circumstances, are playing a different game than you..</p>
