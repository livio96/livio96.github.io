            <h2>Mutual Cravings.</h2>
            <p>I've always believed that what makes the world so special is how different people are. We all have ‘crazy’ and diverse wants and needs, which are exactly what give life its great dynamics and diversity. However, as different as we are, as humans, we have a lot of things in common — some of those things I like to call mutual cravings. Regardless of who you are, where you come from, or what age you are, most probably these mutual cravings apply to everyone, to you and the people around you.</p>
            <p>Let me point out four that i feel are extremely important to mention:</p>
            <h4>1- Sympathy</h4>
            <p>In his great book “How to win friends and influence people” Dale Carnegie writes:<br>
<strong>“Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.” {Page 208}</strong><br>
Carnegie, explains that a statement that can immediately stop arguments (when you are arguing with someone) and immediately makes the other person feel better about you is the following: “Yes? All right. Here it is. Begin by saying: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I should undoubtedly feel just as you do.” People want to know that they are not alone, that there is someone else in this world that sympathisez their point of view, and that they agree with them.</p><br>
           <h4>2-Respect and Admiration</h4>
           <p>n one of his blog posts Morgan Housel writes:<br>
<strong>"Everyone’s will be different, but I suspect most people would want their obituary to say: You were respected. You were admired. You were helpful. You were a good parent, and good spouse, a caring friend. You were an asset to your community. You made a contribution to your industry. You were wise, funny, and smart".</strong>
The statement above summarizes it all. There is no human being who has ever walked this planet and did not want respect and admiration. It’s a universal desire. Unfortunately, some people use their possessions to earn respect and admiration instead of relying on their values and virtues, but that is a totally separate discussion.</p><br>
           <h4>3-We all want appreciation</h4>
           <p>Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.” William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” He didn’t speak, mind you, of the “wish” or the “desire” or the “longing” to be appreciated. He said the “craving” to be appreciated. This is a universal want and need. Nobody is every going to stick around you long enough, if they don’t feel like their presence is being appreciated. Not even your spouse or your children. As humans, we crave appreciation, we always has and we always will.</p>
           <br>
           <h4>4-Triggered emotions and personal benefits</h4>
           <p>You will never get someone to do something for you unless they are emotionally incentivized to do so. You may argue that you can pay someone to perform a task even if they don’t feel like doing it. That is true, but it is not something that holds great value. Nobody will ever endure a disease for you, nobody will ever endure pain for you, and nobody will ever sacrifice their mental well-being for you, regardless of how much financial incentive you provide.. Carnegie once wrote:
<br><strong>“There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything…And that is by making the other person want to do it”.</strong><br>
You can’t force engagement — it has to be real and authentic. If someone ever does something for you, even though they don’t want to, trust me, its going to be temporary. It will last less than you think.</p>
