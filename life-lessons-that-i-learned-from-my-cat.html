            <h2>Life Lessons That I Learned From My Cat</h2>
            <h4>You don’t need much to be happy in life.</h4>
            <p>Your pet probably doesn’t need much to be happy: food, water, and a comfortable place to live and sleep. That’s all — and they will seem perfectly content. Sometimes, I am actually jealous of the fact that so little can bring so much joy to my cat. I wish all humans were like that. And I don’t mean we should not strive to improve our lives and always aim for better, but realizing that the sense of having enough is a great feeling in life.</p>
            <h4>Be curios.</h4>
            <p>Just as my cat is curious about every single corner of the house and every object he touches, that’s how we should be too. I don’t mean in messing in other people’s business, but always curious to learn more, to figure out new things, and to treat every unknown as a significant opportunity. This is great advice for life, your career, and your business.</p>
            <h4>Don’t let unimportant things upset you.</h4>
            <p>Do cats and dogs ever get upset? I’m sure they do. I’m sure they get frustrated just like we do when things ‘don’t go their way.’ However, one thing I admire about my cat is that he does not hold grudges for months or years. He forgets what upset him a minute ago and moves on quickly. I implemented that in my life many years ago, and my life has improved exponentially. I recommend you try it too.</p>
            <h4>Sometimes doing nothing can be productive.</h4>
            <p>Cats and dogs can sit all day, staring at the wall, and they will seem perfectly content. We tend to believe that the busiest part of our day is the most productive. I can tell you for a fact that it’s not. The most productive part of your day is when your mind is relaxed and creative. Taking a shower, going for a walk, or simply resting for a few minutes in your bed can work wonders. Most people whose jobs depend on creativity, appreciate the power of downtime, walks, showers, etc more than anyone else.</p>
            <h4>Maintain a schedule</h4>
            <p>I am so jealous of the fact that my cat has a strict schedule. I wish I had one too. He wakes up at 5 AM, goes back to sleep at noon, wakes up again at 3 PM, and then stays up until about 12 AM. Obviously, human lives are more complicated than that. We have more commitments, and I am not comparing my life to my cat’s life by any means, but the power of having a strict schedule is enormous. I highly recommend that you try to stick to a strict schedule as well.</p>
            <h4>We are not meant to be alone.</h4>
            <p>Cats and dogs hate to be alone. The truth is they are not meant to stay alone. Actually, after a few days of being alone, you can start seeing signs of ‘depressive behavior.’ Humans are not meant to be alone either. We need people around us. We need friends and family around us to make our lives meaningful.</p>
            <h4>Others’ opinions should have 0 effect on you.</h4>
            <p>Do you think your cat or your dog understands you? Probably, especially when they are looking for food or when you scold them for touching something they are not supposed to touch. However, they don’t really care about your opinion. If you think they are noisy, messy, or reckless, then they probably are, but that does not mean that they will be greatly affected by it. They don’t understand anything else you say other than ‘here is your food,’ and maybe that’s how we should be too. When someone judges your personality, your behavior, or your life choices, try not to be too affected by them. In the end, you only have one life to live, so make sure you always remember, ‘Your life is your choice.’</p>
