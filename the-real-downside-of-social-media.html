            <h2>The Real Downside Of Social Media</h2>
            <p>I did some research to find out when the happiest time in American history was, and this is what I found: Psychology researchers from Warwick University in the UK found that happiness reached its peak in the 1920s in America before being sent plunging by the Great Depression. The outbreak of the Second World War sent happiness levels to an all-time low before a brief recovery in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
           <p>During these years, technology, healthcare, education, automobile, transportation, space technology, etc., were not as advanced as they are today. Furthermore, during this period, the average American income was $3,300 compared to almost $60,000 in 2023. How come we get to enjoy so much more today, and we have access to so many things that people did not have 70–80 years ago, and yet we are not happier by any means? I thought very hard about this and I realized that the answer to this question is what Montesquieu said about 280 years ago:</p>
           <br>
           <p><i>“If you only wished to be happy, that could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, because we believe others to be happier than they are.”</i></p>
           <p>Most of our unhappiness comes from <a href="https://www.mentalliquidity.com/social-comparison.html">social comparison</a> and unfortunately, this is what social media has been heavily promoting for almost 17 years since Facebook first came out. In social media today, everyone can see the fake lifestyles that other people try to promote, and you compare yourself to your peers. However, what you don’t realize is that you are not comparing your life to something that is necessarily real and consistent. What people show on social media is the ‘bright’ side of their lifestyle: You see the cars other people drive, homes they live in, expensive jewelry that they wear, and expensive vacations that they go on. Then immediately, you say, ‘I want to have that — I want to be happy like them’.</p>
          <p>Americans in the 1950s and 1960s had less, but they did not care too much about comparison. That’s the main reason they were happier. The empty but rich lifestyles of a few people on social media inflated the expectations and wants of other people. Rising expectations, when you don’t have the means to support them, are destructive. Social comparison is destructive, and the sooner you realize that, the easier your way to happiness and fulfillment.</p>
