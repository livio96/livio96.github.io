            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p><i>When your expectations grow faster than reality, you have opened the door to unhappiness and disappointment.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Literally one of the smartest people that has ever walked this planet.</p>
            <p>In 2004 the New York Times interviewed Stephen Hawking, the scientist whose incurable motor-neuron disease has left him paralyzed and unable to talk since he was 21 years old. Through his computer, Hawking told the interviewer how excited he was to sell books to lay people.
               <br><i>“Are you always this cheerful?” the Times asked.</i>
               <br><i>“My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus” he replied.</i>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Low expectations increase your happiness.</strong> One of the main reasons why people say that there is no correlation between money and happiness is because people’s expectations rise with their income. If you have enough money and wealth to buy more stuff, or to enjoy nice things, but at the same time, you want more stuff and your expectations go up, do you really have enough? Do you really feel rich?</p>
            <p>The same thing happens with age. It’s extremely easy to surprise or amaze a 5-year-old who hasn’t experienced enough in life. A 5-year-old has low expectations. A walk in the park or a couple of gifts can blow children’s minds, and they are perfectly content doing that. Most of the time they are more cheerful and happier than most adults. As we get older and experience more in life, our expectations go up. That is why it is very difficult to feel happy when you are an adult.</p>
            <p>Expectations are moods, and moods, almost by definition, are the gap between what’s happening and how people interpret what’s happening. It’s great to have high expectations about your future, your family, or your career. However, expectations need to be proportional to the amount of work and effort that you put in to achieve your life and career goals. You can expect someone to give you joy, but you can't expect someone to make you happy. You are the one that works on your own happiness.</p>
            <p>Vermin Supreme has a great quote:</p>
            <p><i>“When you create hope in people, you create expectations. When you do not fulfill those expectations, when the change becomes more of the same old, same old, the Hope that was created can only turn to anger, frustration, and bitter disappointment.”</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Let me summarize all this in a simple formula:</p>
            <p>Happiness = reality — expectations.</p>
            <p>The lower your expectations, the higher the level of happiness.</p>
            <br><br>
