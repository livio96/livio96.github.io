            <h2>Reading Nourishes The Mind And The Soul</h2>
            <p>I turned daily reading into a habit when I was 15 years old, and since then, I have never stopped. I try to encourage the people I care about (family and friends) to make reading a part of their daily routine, but very often the response I get is: ‘Ugh… I’m too busy; I don’t have time for it.’”</p>
            <p>Well, the thing is that I have never met a human being who has more than 24 hours in their day, so I don’t think being busy is an excuse. The truth is that almost all successful people have one thing in common — they love to read. So, to all the people who say that they are too busy to read, I’ll just tell them that they are not busier than Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, or Jeff Bezos; that’s almost guaranteed — and as busy as they are, they find time to read. It’s just a matter of turning it into a habit, and all I ask for is 30 minutes a day. There is no person on Earth who doesn’t “waste” 30 minutes of their day, so I highly recommend turning that wasted time into reading time</p>
            <p>You don’t need to read all day and all night; its not efficient and productive, but you need to read daily, and 30 minutes a day is a great start.</p>
            <p>In his book “The Art of Living an Exceptional Life” Jim Rohn writes:</p>
            <p><i>“Read or Listen everyday; don’t miss one day. Miss a meal, but not your 30 minutes of reading. Hey, you can get along without some meals, but you cannot get along without some ideas, examples, and inspiration”</i></p>
            <p>Investing 30 minutes a day to read, learn, gather ideas, and get inspired is a truly cost-effective investment with a high return. I strongly urge you to read about a topic of interest (and I refuse to believe that you don’t have a topic of interest because we all do).</p>
            <p>Here is a personal story that may inspire you: When I was a teenager, I used to think of reading books as “a lot of work,” and in all fairness, reading books is a big time commitment. However, very quickly, my perception changed. Let me explain how. One day, I told myself that just like I didn’t find soccer boring, then almost guaranteed I wouldn’t find a book about soccer boring. So basically, I focused on a topic that I was passionate about, and you can do the same (it could be health, money, investing, sports, fashion, cooking, etc.). The first book I read was about soccer, and I loved it. Then I slowly started exploring other fields. I began focusing on catchy titles, like, for example, “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill — I told myself, “Wow, that sounds good — who doesn’t want to think and grow rich?” and that was all I needed — books became a part of my life.</p>
            <p>If you are reading this, I highly recommend that you stop procrastinating and begin reading and educating yourself today. Education does not stop after you graduate from college; it becomes even more interesting and important after you finish school. Having a good library in your house or on your Kindle will change your life. The books you read will reveal that you are a dedicated student, eager to learn, and most importantly, unafraid of exploring new ideas and, in the future, implementing them to live the life you’ve always wanted.</p>
            <p>A Bible phrase says that: “After bread, the next most important substance are words. Words nourish the mind, words nourish the soul”. I like to say that reading nourishes the mind, reading nourishes the soul.</p>
