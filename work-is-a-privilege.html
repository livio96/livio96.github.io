            <h2>Work Is A Privilege</h2>
           <p>Here is a fable that i love:</p>
           <p><i>"A man found himself in a wonderful place after he died. Everywhere he looked, he was amazed by the beautiful view. He was enjoying delicisious food, beautiful music and he was surrounded by beautiful young women. However after some time he realized that he got bored and he told himself “this is not my dream in the world, — this is not what I want to do”. He saw another gentlemen and asked him if he could help him do something else cause he was bored. He asked if the gentleman could help him get a job. The response he got was “sorry sir but there is no work here for you”. The man was very frustrated and started screaming — “Then Ill just stay in hell”, and the other person replied “Where do you think you are at?”</i></p>
           <p>This is a fun fable, but it teaches a powerful lesson: Work is a privilege. Only people who are not productive understand the power of productivity and work. Work and productivity are the foundations of happiness, fulfillment, and a sense of accomplishment.</p>
           <p>I really admire people who have career ambitions, because they work really hard to achieve their career goals. Notice I mentioned goals and not income. Income is just a scorecard. What really matters is your work and your level of productivity. Your salary is just a scorecard that shows how well you are performing. All people who have a successful career don’t focus too much on income, but on their goals. If you focus on your goals and do your job well, the ideal income will come.</p>
           <p>I hear a lot of people complain about their jobs and how miserable they feel because they are being treated like slaves at work. In all honesty, sometimes I feel guilty of this myself. Out of frustration, I feel that I am not being productive, and I start blaming the environment and management for most things that don’t go my way. The truth is that the perfect employer doesn’t exist. You create your own ideal environment by staying focused and showing full commitment and dedication to what you do every day. More importantly, the highest reward for our hard work is not what we receive but what we will become.</p>
           <p>There is a saying, ‘if you start working a job you love, you won’t work ever again,’ and the truth is that most of us may not find the ideal job or career. However, you can turn what you do into an ideal job and career. Whether you are working for yourself or someone else, you will always face challenges and have days when you want to give up. The truth is that as long as you put your heart into doing what you believe is right and productive work, you will be rewarded tenfold.</p>
           <p>Let me close this post by quoting a short paragraph from John D. Rockefeller:</p>
           <p><i>Heaven and hell are created by ourselves. If you give meaning to your work, your will feel happy regardless of its size and you will fulfilled no matter what self-set results you have attained. If you don’t like to do anything, even the simplest things will become difficult and boring. When you lament that this work is very tiring, despite not working hard, you will feel exhausted, in other words there is a huge difference. This is how things are.</i></p>
