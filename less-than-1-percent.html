        <h2>Less Than 1%</h2>
        <p>A tail event is a rare and extreme occurrence that has a significant impact on the outcome of a situation. People tend to ignore tail events, but I am fully convinced of the following statement: “Tails drive everything.” Why is it that we ignore tail events? The reason is simple — because they are so hard to measure, making it very difficult to understand their importance. The probability of a tail event is so small that our minds don’t even consider them as a possibility. Would you bet on something that has less than a 1% chance of happening? I am sure you wouldn’t, or at least you would think about it a thousand times.</p>
        <p>Let me give you a few examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The S&P 500 gained 108% over the last five years. Only 22 companies are responsible for half that gain.</li>
          <li>The Nasdaq index gained 32% in last 2 years. Only 5 companies made up 51% of that return.</li>
          <li>A corporate has hundreds or thousands of employees but 1% of decisions that the CEO will make, can change everything for better or worse.</li>
          <li>In business or investing you could be wrong 1000 times and just be right once, and you can still do great.</li>
          <li>Our planet is the only one out of 100 billion in our galaxy that we know has life. The Earth makes up about 0.0003% of the total mass of our solar system.</li>
          <li>More than 109 billion people have walked this planet, but less than 0.000000001% of the people have changed the course of human history.</li>
          <li>Thousands of historical events have happened in the last century, but only a few of them have changed the world forever (World War I, World War 2, Great Depression, 9/11 etc)</li>
          <li>Of the 300,000,000 human sperm ejaculated during coitus, only about 200 reach the site of fertilization in the oviduct. In the end, only 1 lucky sperm out of this group of 200 actually penetrates and fertilizes the egg, to later create life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And list goes on and on……</p>
        <p>In a Business Insider Ignition conference in New York, Jeff Bezos said:</p>
        <p>
          <i>“I’ve made billions of dollars of failures at amazon.com. However, none of those things are fun, but they also don’t matter.A few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn’t work”.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Here is a recommendation: When you watch the news and read articles online, try to focus on what really matters. The truth is that 99% of the things you hear or learn will be irrelevant in the near future, and only 1% will have an impact on your life. That’s how the world has worked in the past, and that is how it will always work.</p>
        <p>Long tails drive everything. They dominate business, investing, sports, politics, products, careers — everything. Scientists tell us that the odds of you being born are 1 in 400,000,000,000,000. And yet, with those incredibly low odds, you are here reading this post. We spend most of our day focusing on big things, huge things that we believe to be life-changing, but the truth is they are not. What is truly life-changing is the result of a tail event, an event that nobody sees coming, but it’s so powerful that it will be remembered forever.</p>
