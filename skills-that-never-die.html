            <h2>Skills That Never Die</h2>
            <p>There are several ways to gain a competitive advantage, and the most common belief is in trying to be different from anyone else — different from your peers, your competition, your co-workers, etc. The question is, how different can you really be? At the end of the day, there is always someone who will possess your skillset, have the same mindset, and maybe even be better at what you do, so being both different and better is challenging.</p>
            <p>As I started thinking about different ways to gain a competitive advantage, I realized that there are a handful of ‘soft skills’ that will never fail. These skills will always be valuable, and if implemented in the right way, at the right moment, they can work wonders.</p>
            <p>Let me mention a few and express my thoughts on each:</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>1- The ability to learn faster than anyone else.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>IQ is not a measure of anything but our general intellectual abilities. Intelligence includes our ability to learn from and interact with everything in our immediate environment, including other people. There are millions of smart people in the world, and you don’t necessarily need to outsmart everyone, but one thing you should be obsessed with is trying to grasp new knowledge a little faster than your competition. That little bit of knowledge that you can digest before someone else can make a huge difference.</p>
            <br>
           <p><b>2-The ability to communicate more effectively than anyone else</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Communication is key. Kevin O’Leary once said that successful entrepreneurs need to meet a lot of criteria, but first, they need to articulate their vision in 90 seconds or less. The world is too busy to listen to your bull***t. No one has time for non-sense. In school, they ask you to write a paper that’s at least 9 pages long, but in real life, you only have 90 seconds to make a point. Being able to get your message across in a concise and organized way is crucial in almost everything you do.</p>
             <br>
           <p><b>3- The willingness to be more patient than anyone else.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Sometimes good things take time. Being more patient than most can sometimes do wonders. Having hope that something can work out in your favor if you just give it a little bit more time can be life-changing. Just to clarify something — make sure you don’t confuse stubbornness with patience. Don’t be too stubborn to continue pursuing something that is not worth pursuing. Make sure you are patient with things that are worth being patient for.</p>
             <br>
           <p><b>4- Being optimistic — constantly reminding yourself that the past was not as great as you thought, and the future will be better than you think.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>I love optimism. I love the idea that things will eventually get better. I always try to remind myself that there are going to be thousands of obstacles along the way, but I will never lose hope that human beings will always be able to solve problems, and what the future holds is much better than what the past offered.</p>
            <br>
           <p><b>5- Sensing the approach of decline.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Nothing lasts forever, and we all know that at some point, everything dies down. You will never know the peak success of something until you start experiencing the decline. This is for sure the hardest skill out of the five that I mentioned above. For some people, this will be an impossible task throughout their entire life, and I have personally tried my hardest to develop this skill, and I am still not good at it. This is hard because it’s like trying to predict the future, and predicting the future is impossible. However, having a good sense for things going south has always been a rewarding skill, and it will save you a lot of suffering, time wasting, and, more importantly, mental exhaustion.</p>
