            <h2>Emotion Outweighs Rational Thought.</h2>
            <p>I have always done, and sometimes still do, things that may not seem rational, but for some reason, I still thought they were the right things to do. That used to bother me until I dug deeper into this, and I finally realized that I am not alone. Most people do things that are not strictly rational but are driven by reason and emotion. Emotion can influence people more profoundly than any other rational thought.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are a couple of examples: </strong></p><br>
            <p>Right after 9/11 air travel fell significantly. People were scared to fly, so obviosly the car travel jumped. Of course, after an event like 9/11 most people thought that planes were more dangerous than cars. But statistically this is false. The fatality risk of flying is 0.23% — you would need to fly every day for more than 10,000 years to be in a fatal plane crash. On the other hand, the chances of dying in a car collision are about 1 in 101, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). So for all these people that avoided flying the year after 9/11, this was not a rational decision, it was an emotial one.</p>
           <p>Data shows that, 50% of Americans buy more than 10 lottery tickets a year.Actually bringing home the big check in any lottery is next to impossible. The odds are about one in 300 million. Yeah, it’s a longshot, but still most people do it. Americans spent $108 billion on lottery tickets in 2022. That is a huge amount of money. We all know that investing some of that money would be way more beneficial, but still that’s never the case. A few months ago, I asked a gentleman who spent 180 dollars on lottery tickets in one shot: “Why did you spend so much? The chances of you winning are 1 in 300 million — you spending 180 dollars, wont make any difference. His response was: “I know most likely I will not become a millionaire overnight, but I just bought hope, 3 days worth of hope”. That is so powerful. A typical example of an emotional decision.</p>
           <p>Logic and reason requires thinking and time expended to identify facts. This takes (sometimes) considerable cognitive effort. Decision based on feelings requires little effort and is rewarded with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Given the choice, people will take the least effort maximum reward path. This often leads into making terrible decisions, especially if in that moement we are very emotional, and we are not thinking straight.</p>
           <p>Dale Carnegie once said, <i><strong>“When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion.”</i></strong> This statement essentially encapsulates the idea that humans are creatures driven by emotion. It’s not that we completely disregard rationality, but when it comes to significant life decisions, we often prioritize our emotions. We unconsciously follow our emotions in various aspects of life, such as making purchases, dating, spending money, traveling, and forming friendships. It’s simply an integral part of our nature.</p>
           <p>Because emotions are embedded within us, suggesting that individuals should begin prioritizing more logical choices might appear like a bad advice. The optimal approach for navigating challenging life decisions involves integrating both emotional instincts and rational thoughts, creating a balanced decision-making process before arriving at a conclusion.</p>
